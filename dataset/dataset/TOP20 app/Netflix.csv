b6f08a40-4e96-48ae-89a7-f12c73c0a0dc,Please do some enhancement on the subtitles. Only white colored font doesn't help user to read those subtitles. Can't even see anything. Had to pause and dimmer the brightness just to read the subtitles. Please do add black background color for those subtitles as usual. I guess the white font with no background are mostly on the new dramas especially animes. Do something Netflix!!! Paid my money not for to observe the subtitles!!!,2

64acdb54-df2d-42c7-bc28-f109ca5389f4,I think what Netflix needs is some sort of a social feature that YouTube/Chinese video streaming platforms have. That community interaction. The respective country social media accounts are not making it (at least in the sea region),4

a83e8d4d-e9fb-4ed5-9ed3-645174a693a3,My Netflix account got hacked and hacker after making a payment of 6.99 pound was able to make the email change. Hacker has somekind of api by which he can update phone number and get the access of the account. I was not using the account from last 6 month. Netflix save the payment details permanently which is very surprising. Netflix is most vulnerable app as user cannot remove payment information even if you want to go away from it.,1

Since spongebob is so widely known and liked within society it would make audiences such as me and many others grateful. By doing so, Netflix will increase the amount of spongebob fans and this can lead to further success within your business etc. I hope Netflix takes this into deep consideration and will follow my request.

Movies must have been complaining cuz TV Series beat them the majority of the time. Add A NETFLIX CATEGORY TO GENRES. Quality shows should air once a week instead of binge watching it all at once,3

Offer annual subscriptions, 2. Fire woke writers, 3. Open up a porn website, if you really can't help but create something like 365 days",2

5c96be7a-371f-45de-9b72-820abcd3c1d3,I reside in South Korea but I don't speak Korean and many shows don't have English subtitle options that are available in an American Netflix account. Please keep the English subtitles for all shows in Korea that have that option in America. There are a lot of foreigners in Korea that cannot enjoy a show on their Netflix account because the English subtitles are not available.,3

Your settings override anything i set on my phone or tv. So i cant use your service after dark because it is so bright my kid cant fall to sleep with it on watching supposedly sleeping videos. I end up using a free service w the same shows. Why do we need you? . So why do i pay you when i cant control the simple brightness.how hard is it to put a sub or dub label on a show details on top?,2

If they are completely white (they currently are completely white) they will practically disappear if the background video is too bright. The best way around this is to at leas add a black border to the letters. It's really annoying when you can't read the subtitles because of the inefficient color / font type.,1

The lack of customisation you are given for viewing and the rubbish design layout / ui... Is really frustrating irritating. GET BETTER. What made me really want to post this is you cannot even customiser the font color of subtitles in the app. You have to access Netflix on web browser and why did they think setting subtitles to white was a good idea, instead of the default black.

Some shows have bold white texts & black rectangles on the subtitle's background blocking the visual, while some other shows have thin white texts & transparent subtitle background which makes it hard to read especially on white background?

They claimed they would have the issue fixed soon. I asked for a credit since my Netflix account is unusable until further notice. They said no.

2ca3fdaa-15b9-41c3-9f48-22a1859cc2f3,In my opinion Netflix is one of the best streaming apps available. It is reasonably priced and even if you are subscribed to the basic plan you can enjoy quality up to 480p which isn't too bad for just £10.99. The premium plan provides the best quality and I recommend it if the £15.99 is within your budget because some of the premium advantages are crazy. For example 4K Ultra HD streaming and allows four screens to use the subscription at once (from 4 different devices). Minor bug fixes needed.,4

If you don't have the premium they don't want you to be able to watch anything unless you upgrade. So disappointed. So many shows we watch on Netflix and cannot watch any of them. I'm cancelling service. Customer service blames it on your TV. I have two tvs and it doesn't work on any of them. Do better Netflix!",1

Downloaded this app finally wanted to use it today i could only see the title screen but when clicked on show more like an audio book because no picture. and not even 2 weeks later it asked to update. Wouldn't update so I Uninstalled and reinstalled now it won't even let me log in. Everytime I try it tries to log in and says logged out and back to log in screen. So uninstalled again. Reinstalled and I am going to see if it finally works. Nope. Still can't get in➖❌,1

I watch 8 episodes in a weekend, then you make me wait another year for 8 more episodes that are once again gone in a weekend. Not cool!!! Had to drop the stars, way to much Homosexual garbage and no way to screen it out. My children will never be allowed access to Netflix on their own screen.",1

df5bfa4e-8922-4d6e-8d20-73eb5b1f5b36,Why Netflix does not understand that in India there are 70% of population who don't understand English(Number might vary). When you mix up the Hindi series/movies with English language(talking about adding 30% English in Hindi series/movies) in between they break the whole rhythm for the ones who don't understand English language. And because of that even the great work by Netflix can be undermine.,2

Unlike others you can watch full season's of a series without having to purchase the last couple of season's. For me Netflix is second to none.,5

Go to your profile and choose subtitle appearance. After that you need to clean the app cache so it'll work on your mobile app version. This is really tricky. Why don't just put the subtitle setting on the app version too?,4

I am one of those people who are devastated at the loss of a comfort show I've been watching since I was 7.

e18f0b16-630d-49eb-a8e3-4a900a170274,Love watching the movies and TV shows. Netflix if your gonna do the original shows keep them going. Don't cancel after season 1. Just petty. Example julie and the phantoms. You just cancel there season 2 without trying. That's why I will never understand why you make the first season in the first place. Put there hopes up and feel like they have a future. That's messed up. So many levels. I'm saying all the tv shows and movies.,3

f676ca24-a762-4f85-a407-1c1281abedd6,I've changed my review due to the fact that you have added more movies but if you lose your remote control or your remote just happens to break on your TV Netflix doesn't have a built-in remote like YouTube does whenever using cast so you're stuck unfortunately not being able to watch Netflix at all until you buy a new remote just thought I would pass that on that maybe that's something you guys should think about updating just a thought 🤷🏾‍♀️,4
