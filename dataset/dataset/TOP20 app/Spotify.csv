Now it just stops playing for no reason.Once my phone is about half full: it won't download properly. It erases other songs ; and if I go offline; it only plays a few albums. And it deletes a song or two from downloaded albums when a new album is downloaded; and plays the same couple hundred songs out of twenty thousand liked. Probably going to return to the advertising model.,1

Unlike Deezer (tho I can't recommend that in good faith either), telling the system you dislike a song doesn't apply to the whole platform. Spotify has been shoving songs/artists I told it I dislike in my face nonstop since day 1, and there is no way to make it stop. Bonus points for the desktop version of the app somehow having even less control over your music than on the mobile app? All around nothing about this app's ui makes any sense.",2

Also for years now the metal section has been abandoned and no new albums updated there. It's a joke now. Tidal is 10/10 compared to this 1/10. Spotify gets 1 star as it looks great. All style.

Playing the music on one device(pc/gane console) and try to switch songs will only work until you lock your phone. After that its a total desync.

A subscription can give you extra boost and bonuses perks etc but what this company is doing is forcing people into subscription by deliberately limiting basic music listeningfunctions. They are abusing their service and taking advantage of the customers. It's a criminal offense. These people need to be brought to Justice. This is basically digital Extortion.,1

Bob Wayne's workingan is only 3:45? Why 7:30 on 3:45 song? Chop that to your data entry team. Bravo. And you only allow like 5 different songs per artist to play on free version. SUCKS. And you should give premium free with ADs you force like 6 in a row. Your being paid to show the ADs why you feel you need paid twice is insane. And pathetic. Official onestar,1

I have to address a very big issue, in my opinion, and that's the lack of features with the free spotify plan. It simply feels like they are almost forcing you to buy the premium plan, the amount of ads you get shown. three 30 second ads and two 15 second ads. you only get 6 skips per hour, with the inability to peak at the next song in the free plan, it just feels cruel at times",4

Why all of a sudden are there suggested songs on it??? I play that list because I know I won't be skipping a song....but now there's A LOT of suggested songs on there and I absolutely hate it. Why not make a suggested songs list? Or stick them all at the end? Why call it a liked songs list if you add songs I haven't liked?,3

I can pick what songs and genres I listen to by making a playlist. (I actually have multiple playlists) The only thing I would change is how many ads there are. I understand that they need to put ads in but sometimes there will be six ads in a row or more. I use the free version and have had no other issues. For me the benefits outweigh the ad problem though. Highly recommend this app!,4

Unfortunately, the recent update has taken away the always-on notification when the app is open or in the background. This has caused the playback notification to disappear after pausing the music for 1-30 seconds, which means you have to open up the app, hit play, then continue with what you were doing. Spotify Connect seems to be broken as well. It won't sync if the app is open; it has to be restarted.",2

78de6232-fb53-4a68-a781-84a3da20317e,i have been useing this app for like 2 3 months. For a very high profile app this app is very poor. Its so slow and these are alot of glitches in the app. It take forever to open even when its open it takes forever to play a song. Even if i am using the free version it makes some sense that its a poor app but it doesn't make sense to be so slow and glitchy when i am paying for it. Please tell me it is by default or stop advertising it as a very high profile app when it doesn't work like it.,2
