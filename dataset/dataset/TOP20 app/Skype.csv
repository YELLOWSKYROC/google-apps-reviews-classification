16c04978-c98a-4bf1-926f-c19c812101a0,Unpredictable subscription terms.... I bought an unlimited call package for a month and after few hours it changed into 60min subscription. Also I lost access to my Microsoft account for few days because I merged it to my Skype account. Apparently Microsoft and Skype are not closely tied together in that aspect. Quite a stressful experience with Skype and feel a bit uncertain about it's promises.,1

9b3bef41-dcae-49cd-91e7-8c08ab7261b6,This app is good but if any phone call is connected while the skype call is on we can't hear back the voice after the phone call is disconnected. We have to disconnect the call and dial them back which is the only option. This is lingering and apps getting hanged sometimes though the network is good. Not sure what could be the reason. Voice call and call ring quality is not upto the mark. This works wonderfully in WhatsApp but lags here in skype,3

It is one of the few (email to email) chat programs remaining that offers audio and video chat. We used to use Hangouts for nearly 20 years, but our family had to switch to Skype, because Hangouts rolled into Google Meet, and no longer rings properly. Skype does not have that problem at all. The Windows version of this app runs flawlessly but the android app is quirky. Fix the MP3 Messaging!",5

Willvtake its time sending and say updating conversation. Randomly crash now.

They removed that ability and now my camera covers up people I'm trying to video call with. The overlay feature for Android breaks often so you can't see the other person's camera while outside the app. Also they need to add audio controls for when your not using a Bluetooth headset. Sometimes the audio routes to the headset instead of speaker while in video calls and you can't switch unless you reconnect them.,2

Also any time my headset is plugged on Skype, my phone inexplicably thinks I'm pushing the volume-down key, and won't stop popping up the ring volume bar WHICH BLOCKS THE START CALL BUTTON.

7216a90c-626e-494c-961b-cedcdb4b7cb7,Microsoft can't code apparently because Skype is perhaps the worst performing app on my Android phone. I dread having to get a security PIN code via for signing into other apps as it's then begins a game of trying to answer Skype which doesn't respond to me pressing the answer button half the time. And then when it does it simply closes again or there's no voice. I get the PIN code maybe 10% of the time. And when I do I go back to the apps which have then refreshed and need a new code.,1
