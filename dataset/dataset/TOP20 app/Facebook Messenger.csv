8eb5570b-97b0-434b-bc18-ae0c195c5707,I don't like the bubble feature. The chat head was way more better than bubble. I hope you guys would change it back. And the bubble was kinda confusing.,2

8a3c15ee-a875-48db-a01d-d90c1cbdae54,App is great and all but there's still glitches.Honestly though it could have a lot of potential to it. Also I have a suggestion to add a way to delete everything you've ever said on a gc or to a person even if you've deleted the copy of the convo that would be pretty useful for a lot people.,2

In the midst of video streaming, when a person have seen and sent a message, it stopped and glitches- freezing on screen. There are times my I can't seem to sent a message and receives an error prompt. This issue have been happening to my friends too with different smartphone brands. Also disappointed that I can no longer send a file format (pdf, word, txt, etc.) and .gif format images via mobile.",3

4b949504-d883-40fc-85e8-600d2fc84c8f,"My experiences with Messenger have usually been very good. The one thing I do wish would be different with Messenger is, they really should NOT automatically make people's phone numbers available. That should be *only* done with the person's consent. Including ability to call or to text or leave voicemails or to in any way contact anyone via phone conversations or anywhere other than on Messenger itself. People's privacy should be more protected. Messenger should just be for Messenger messages.",5

Messenger keeps asking me if I want to route all my SMS functions and phone functions through it. I don't. What I do want is to be able to turn off ""calls""/voice chat requests. Messenger also tracks your phone, which I don't like. If I need to loan my phone to someone so they can access messages, their account ends up associated with mine.",1

Hence the other party thought that you are not answering but in fact you are just offline. Can you provide a solution to this like when you are calling a cellphone number, it will just prompt that the number cannot be reached if it is off or having no signal. Hope you can attend to this swiftly. Thanks & brgds,",3

36be5e02-dceb-4e2e-93c4-79aaac703035,I want to thank Steve Foster for taking 2 days to sell me a quality used car! Steve was very patient with me and helped me from the beginning of the process all the way to taking me to my bank and getting me my full time insurance. I highly recommend Steve Foster & H & H Kia for all your vehicle needs. I see why they call Steve the Batman!!,5

a52c1928-b8ca-49a3-88ba-010c6fad5dba,Lately I'm having the issue where messenger bubble freezes the apps that it's over. Its inconvenient. Lots of features and buttons in messenger are badly designed and hard to find when you need them. Like rolling out an entire chat rooms feature that's not controllable over the app. Woooo it's Facebook in 2022.,2

I made an account yet the page to link your old messenger account with your Facebook is broken. I can't even make a new one because it redirects me to the old one and then the broken page comes up again. Now I physically can't text or even see the texts to my account. I've lost all my conversations. And all that because you wanted more Facebook users when you've already got billions.,1

Whatever you did to the last 2 updates in the past 2 weeks has messed it up for those of us who actually use it. I cant join or initiate video calls, the media sent to me takes about a day to download, and it's pretty much the worst. In a pandemic when we're all pretty much isolated and I can't communicate with those I love and care for. Fix it asap please. Google duo is about to be the go to for good.",1

Then they'll show, but as soon as I back out of the search function they disappear again.

It's gotten much worse over the years becoming slower and slower, still no optimization, overall I'd recommend this still but be wary of bugs and glitches as they're very very common. It's also incredibly difficult to navigate any kind of settings as they are behind so many subpages that are unnecessary. K.I.S.S. keep it simple stupid. If it were easier to navigate and change settings I would add another star.",3

Latest update makes the app to automatically close, has some difficulty in viewing shared videos in conversations wherein only the audio part plays through while the video is stuck.

Many at times I had gone to the Messenger to set who can message me and who I can message. My all efforts were futile because the Messenger app is still misbehaving and the icons of active friends are not working. many times also it does not open with friend list. it is most pathetic that many people are complaining but nothing is done by Android authorities,1

deb34cea-521b-4658-96f0-3f8ce2282b81,Worst app I've seen ever. Always loading chat menu. I cannot go ahead. I cannot see my old Chats. Always synchronised. Whenever I receive new messages I cannot reach the old ones. The chat menu comes to beginning chat. Very very old interface options. Not yet improved. I cannot hold chat list. Always irritating my mood. I receive lots of messages. But it's not easy to read on same time. So I used to read later. But messenger has no option to hold chat list while receiving new messages.,1

117e2d91-ab0d-4fe4-bc63-9945ecc56387,"The quality of Messenger declined year-by-year. Broken notifications, buggy profile pictures & deleting useful features is just a top of the iceberg. On the downside - no secure messaging at all, there's no encryption even on the server side. In 2022, it is a horrible idea. The content of messages could be easily intercepted - and your secret chats aren't E2E encrypted, if you allow to report the messages from secret chats. Because of that, I've migrated to Telegram & I don't regret doing so.",1
