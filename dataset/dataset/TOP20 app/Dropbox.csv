If you are forced to use it for work I strongly suggest the trial only and to make back up copies of everything, using any of the other cloud storage options. (Google drive, Mega etc) Dropbox is expensive in comparison & deliberately arranges the offline access to make it hard for smartphone users to see where offline files are kept. This is so that if you are not near a desktop, you're forced to continue with a subscription. üßêThat's financial slaveryüò°",1

efc938c2-5816-407b-87f0-675c43e7a677,Initial review: solid mobile client for my purposes. Works well with backing up selected folders on my mobile devices (though it was unclear at first since i had to save new files in order for dropbox to discover other folders and display the option to select which folders to back up) and accessing cloud stored files to upload in other apps. Would be a big improvement to support search when uploading a file to another app and browsing dropbox for files to upload (only works directly in-app),4

15300aed-a133-4d20-9574-50fe3c1874e7,I have no issues with the product. My main issue is the billing. I am trying to move from a monthly plan to an annual one. Because it was purchased through GOogle store. It seems that the only way to do that is to cancel (losing all my data) and open a new account on google. Is that correct? Please let me know if I can choose a better plan and a better way to pay.,5

Major regression in my opinion. This feature used to exist but is no longer possible.

1de285a1-d658-474d-a3af-0c96cf1fd481,Expensive. The recent withdrawal of the Albums feature is typical of the arrogance shown by US tech companies. What possibly could be the justification for the removal or for not giving notice ? It seems Dropbox wants to be business user orientated rather than home users. I'd advise people to use Flickr for photos instead or Amazon,1

Another review from Faraz Q with 32+ upvotes indicates this is a common issue affecting Piel 6 devices. Tried contacting dropbox support but so far their only response is to try reinstalling/updating/restarting app - which doesn;t resolve the issue. Its been over a month now that this issue has been affecting flagship android devices (Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 pro) and as a paying dropbox customer I'd really have expected the issue to have been fixed by this point. Edit Mar 05: I see multiple reviews with 50+ upvotes (eg another one from a user named Drew) mentioning the same issue on pixel devices. Have filed a ticket with dropbox support but so far no real response besides try reinstalling, clearing cache/storage etc which don't work.",1

Even though Google Drive is on my phone, and I use it too, uploads to this are much faster, it's simpler to use, and easier for others to see what I'm sharing. Keep it up!",4

2a181cde-928f-4dff-953a-4b5109cd37dd,"I used Dropbox for years to keep my files safe and to be able to recover them in case anything happened. In the end, it turned out that Dropbox was the worst thing that could have happened. In recent years, they released this online-only feature which makes sure only your most recently used files remain in your hard drive. The other files become online-only which means you see a placeholder on your device and when you try to open it the file gets downloaded first and only then opens. The idea in itself is genius and seemed to work pretty well at first. Eventually, I found out that when copying online-only files from one place to another those files would be copied as 0-byte files without any reference to the original file. I also found out that when uploading online-only files to a website on my browser they get uploaded as 0 bytes instead of the original. This also means that if you move a folder that contains some online-only files those files will be lost because they have no reference to the original and will be uploaded to Dropbox as 0-byte files. At some point, the situation I described above happened to me. I moved a folder from one place to another and a few minutes later decided to revert by moving it back. When I moved the folder my online-only files were moved and upload as 0-byte files and when I reverted my action it didn't matter anymore because they were already just a bunch of 0-byte files on my device and also on the cloud. I only found out a few months later that this happened. Now Dropbox claims that this wasn't their fault. They told me that they simply listen to path changes and upload whatever changes on the Dropbox folder on my device. It isn't their fault that I don't understand how online-only files work and that I didn't make sure they were all downloaded locally first. They refuse to take any responsibility while I lost some of the most important files I ever had. It is extremely upsetting that I have been paying them to keep my files safe and now they simply refuse to recognize that their feature might not be as intuitive as they thought. Even worse is that they claim to no longer have any backups of those files that were lost. Therefore, I have no way of recovering them. Based on this experience I seriously recommend that you stay away from this company if you want to keep your files safe.",1

I use Dropbox to share music with collaborators - I'd prefer not to, but they want to use Dropbox. The latest upgrade now has an embedded player, and it's now easier to share files - so finally after years of the Dropbox app telling me there was no way to open an MP3 file, now there is - but the player can't be backgrounded - how utterly annoying. You need to keep the screen alive to listen to the MP3. There is an option to open the file in Youtube Music - with apparently the option to 'always use this app' - but typical Dropbox, that doesn't work. I'm really unimpressed, this would seem like an obvious feature, you basically can't use your phone for anything else while you are listening to a sound file. Lame. Really lame.

However, it seems that Dropbox is becoming uncompetative compared to other similar cloud storage solutions. Sharing files and folder with (for example) students is easier with Google Drive. Dropbox notes for PDF files is worse than adobe PDF notes, because Dropbox notes save to the Dropbox account instead of the PDF file. And Onedrive saves files from Microsoft Word easier, and is cheaper per GB... (So get your edge Back!!! DB)",3

The idea of hiding offline files in APP cache and refusing access from other APPs is absolutely disgusting. Whenever you want to use your offline files appropriately, you will need to export them and it takes two times as many storage, plus annoying operation. Is it simply a technical issue or you are so desperate to claim ownership of user's files? Might unsubscribe shortly if it is not going to be fixed.",2

I don't and never will have one, this smartphone alone is taking up our lives. And because I was trying to find an expert with a different issue, installed Dropbox again but it's too hard to understand! At bottom says Tell us more, and can't even do that! Must be for computers?

It allows you to zoom in but can't pan and side scroll bars are gone and it becomes blurry so its useless. It used to let me drag and pan documents but now the only way is to download them to pdf and use another program. Will be moving away from dropbox due to this.

43b9d1f1-9ade-4ff1-b163-cca734c72cf0,4 clicks to export 1 photo to my ipad. Multiply it say x 50...or 100 and it becomes nightmare and waste of time. One touch export option and the ability to export entire folders would be great. Otherwise editing pictures is becomes all about trying to export them. These are simple and fundamental functionalities. Thanks. The android app is super heavy even though I don't store files offline-why?,3

You can easily watch a YT video while uploading without feeling anything on Mega 3. If you lock the phone, Dropbox will stop uploading. No other apps on the phone does that, with power saving off too. 4. Dropbox uploads at 200 kbps when it's majesty decides to, Mega always uploads at 1 mbps on my net.
