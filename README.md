# COMP30040 Third Year Project-Classification of app reviews for requirements engineering using deep learning models


## Introduction
App stores like Google Play and Apple AppStore have over 3 million apps covering nearly every kind of software and service. Billions of users regularly download, use, and review these apps. Recent studies have shown that some app reviews written by the users contain a rich source of information for the app developers, as they include information about bugs or ideas for new features. Such information provides raw materials for requirements engineering. However, the majority of app reviews is not informative, as they either praise the app or give irrelevant information.

## Environment
Colab
python 3.8
pytorch
tqdm
sklearn

## Dataset
I have three datasets, balanced(4000) dataset, unbalanced(4000) dataset, balanced(8000) dataset. 
4 label: bug reports, feature requests, user experience, ratings
I have uploaded my dataset to my Github(https://github.com/William-HTP/Google-Play-App-Reviews-Datasets).

## Usage
Run my code in Google Colab, dowmload my datasets from github. 
!git clone https://github.com/William-HTP/Google-Play-App-Reviews-Datasets.git
